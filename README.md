# NASA Image Search App

## 🚀 Overview
A React-based web application that allows users to search and explore NASA images. Users can type in keywords to fetch related space images, view search results in a gallery format, and click on any image to see detailed information. The app provides a smooth and responsive interface for discovering space imagery from NASA’s public API.

## 🛑 Problem
The goal was to build a functional and interactive platform to browse NASA’s extensive image database. Users often struggle to find relevant space images efficiently, and this app makes exploration simple and visually appealing.

## 💡 Solution
I built the app using React with state management to handle search queries, loading states, and search results. The application integrates with NASA’s public API to fetch images dynamically. A separate detail view displays more information about any selected image, enhancing user engagement.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- React  
- React Router  
- Context API for state management  
- NASA API  
- CSS for responsive design
